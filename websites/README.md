Positional head tracking should also be supported on Chrome for Android as of Chrome 56 (though it may also work on Chrome for iOS). To test on the phone, you'll need to replace `localhost` with your local ip to access it on your phone. You'll also need to be on the same wireless network as your development computer on your phone.
